*GIT Class-5 Overview**

1. `git branch`: This command is used to list all the branches in your repository.

git checkout -b branch_name//---  It created a branch    Similarly we can create multiple branch
2. `git merge dev1`: This command is used to merge the changes from the 'dev1' branch into the current branch, which is typically the 'Master' or 'Main' branch.

git merge master 
3. `git branch -d BRANCH_NAME`: This command is used to delete a specified branch, but it should only be used after committing your changes.

git branch -d branch_name
4. It's important to note that the 'Master' or 'Main' branch cannot be deleted.
